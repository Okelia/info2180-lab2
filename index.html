        <h2>Brest Cancer Awareness</h2>
        <h4> October 1, 2020 By American Cancer Society</h4>

        <p> <h5> How Does Breast Cancer Start? </h5> 
          Changes or mutations in DNA can cause normal breast cells to become cancer. Certain DNA changes are passed on from parents (inherited) 
          and can greatly increase your risk for breast cancer. Other lifestyle-related risk factors, such as what you eat and how much you exercise, 
          can increase your chance of developing breast cancer, but it’s not yet known exactly how some of these risk factors cause normal cells to 
          become cancer. Hormones seem to play a role in many cases of breast cancer, but just how this happens is not fully understood.    
        </p>
        <p> <h5> How Common Is Breast Cancer?</h5>
          Breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, except for skin cancers. Currently, the average risk of a woman in the 
          United States developing breast cancer sometime in her life is about 13%. This means there is a 1 in 8 chance she will develop breast
           cancer. This also means there is a 7 in 8 chance she will never have the disease.
        </p>
        <p> <h5> Breast Cancer Signs and Symptoms</h5>
          Knowing how your breasts normally look and feel is an important part of breast health. Although having regular screening tests for 
          breast cancer is important, mammograms do not find every breast cancer. This means it's also important for you to be aware of changes 
          in your breasts and to know the signs and symptoms of breast cancer.
          <br> The most common symptoms of breast cancer are: 
          <ul>
            <li> Hard, painless lump or mass with irregular edges </li>
            <li> Tender, soft, round lump or mass </li>
            <li> Skin dimpling (sometimes looking like an orange peel)</li>
            <li> Brest or nipple pain</li>
            <li> Nipple discharge </li>
            <li> Swollen lymph nodes</li>
          </ul>
          It's important if you are experiencing any of these symptoms or abnormal breast changes you visit a experienced health care professional.

          <h2> The Danger of the Single Story</h2>
          <h4> October 7, 2009 By Chimamanda Adichie </h4>
          <img src ="chimamanda.jpg" alt ="Chimamanda Adichie" height="280" width= auto >
          <p>I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call “the danger of the single story.” 
            I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is 
            probably close to the truth. So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and American children’s books. I was also an early 
            writer, and when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was 
            obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading: All my characters were white and blue-eyed, they played in the 
            snow, they ate apples, and they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out. Now, this despite the fact 
            that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes, and we never talked about the weather, 
            because there was no need to . . .
          </p>
          <p>What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children.
            Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have 
            foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African 
            books. There weren't many of them available, and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like 
            Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye, I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with 
            skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things 
            I recognized.
          </p>
          <p> Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended 
            consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So what the discovery of African writers did for me was 
            this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are.
